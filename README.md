`urlfix` aims to find all outdated URLs in a given file and fix them. 


**Features List**

- [x] Commandline and programmer-friendly modes. 

- [x] Replace outdated URLs/links in a single file

- [x] Replace outdated URLs/links in a directory

- [x] Replace outdated URLs/links in the same file or in the same files in a directory i.e. inplace.

- [x] Replace outdated links in files in nested directories
- [x] Replace outdated links in files in sub-nested directories 

**Supported file formats**

`urlfix` fixes URLs given a file of the following types:

- [x] MarkDown (.md)
- [x] Plain Text files (.txt)

- [x] RMarkdown (.rmd)

- [x] ReStructured Text (.rst)

- [ ] PDF (.pdf)

- [ ] Word (.docx)

- [ ] ODF (.odf)



**Installation**

The simplest way to install the latest release is as follows:

```shell
pip install urlfix

```

To install the development version:


Open the Terminal/CMD/Git bash/shell and enter

```shell

pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git

# or for the less stable dev version
pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git@dev

```

Otherwise:

```shell
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git
cd urlfix
python3 setup.py install

```



**Sample usage**

**Script Mode**

To use at the commandline, please use:

```shell

python -m urlfix --mode "f" --verbose 1 --inplace 1 --inpath myfile.md

```

If not replacing within the same file, then:

```shell

python -m urlfix --mode "f" --verbose 1 --inplace 0 --inpath myfile.md --output-file myoutputfile.md

```



To get help:

```shell
python -m urlfix -h 

#usage: main.py [-h] -m MODE -in INPUT_FILE [-o OUTPUT_FILE] -v {False,false,0,True,true,1} -i {False,false,0,True,true,1}
#
#optional arguments:
#  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#  -m MODE, --mode MODE  Mode to use. One of f for file or d for directory
#  -in INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
#                        Input file for which link updates are required.
#  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
#                        Output file to write to. Optional, only necessary if not replacing inplace
#  -v {False,false,0,True,true,1}, --verbose {False,false,0,True,true,1}
#                        String to control verbosity. Defaults to True.
#  -i {False,false,0,True,true,1}, --inplace {False,false,0,True,true,1}
#                        Should links be replaced inplace? This should be safe but to be sure, test with an output file first.



```

**Programmer-Friendly Mode**

```python

from urlfix.urlfix import URLFix
from urlfix.dirurlfix import DirURLFix

```

**Create an object of class URLFix**

```python

urlfix_object = URLFix("testfiles/testurls.txt", output_file="replacement.txt")

```
**Replacing URLs**

After creating our object, we can replace outdated URLs as follows:

```python

urlfix_object.replace_urls(verbose=1)

```
The above uses default arguments and will not replace a file inplace. This is a safety mechanism to ensure one does not
damage their files. 

Since we set `verbose` to `True`, we get the following output:

```python
urlfix_object.replace_urls()
```

To replace silently, simply set verbose to `False` (which is the default). 

```python
urlfix_object.replace_urls()
```

If there are URLs known to be valid, pass these to the `correct_urls` argument to save some time.

```python 

urlfix_object.replace_urls(correct_urls=[urls_here]) # Use a Sequence eg tuple, list, etc

```


**Replacing several files in a directory**

To replace several files in a directory, we can use `DirURLFix` as follows.

* Instantiate an object of class `DirURLFix`

```python

replace_in_dir = DirURLFix("path_to_dir")

```

* Call `replace_urls`

```python

replace_in_dir.replace_urls()

```

**Recursively replacing links in nested directories**

To replace outdated links in several files located in several directories, we set `recursive` to `True`.
Currently, replacing links in directories nested within nested directories is not (yet) supported.

```python

recursive_object = DirURLFix("path_to_root_directory", recursive=True)

```

We can then proceed as above

```python

recursive_object.replace_urls() # provide other arguments as you may wish. 

```
