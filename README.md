`urlfix` aims to find all outdated URLs in a given file and fix them. 

**Supported file formats**

`urlfix` fixes URLs given a file of the following types:

- [x] MarkDown (.md)
- [x] Plain Text files (.txt)


**Installation**

The simplest way to install the latest release is as follows:

```shell
pip install urlfix

```

To install the development version:


Open the Terminal/CMD/Git bash/shell and enter

```shell

pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git

# or for the less stable dev version
pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git@dev

```

Otherwise:

```shell
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git
cd urlfix
python3 setup.py install

```



**Sample usage**

```python

from urlfix.urlfix import * 

```

**Create an object of class URLFix**

```python

urlfix_object = URLFix("testurls.txt", output_file="replacement.txt")

```
**Replacing URLs**

After creating our object, we can replace outdated URLs as follows:

```python

urlfix_object.replace_urls(verbose=1)

```
The above uses default arguments and will not replace a file inplace. This is a safety mechanism to ensure one does not
damage their files. 

Since we set `verbose` to `True`, we get the following output:

```shell
urlfix_object.replace_urls()
Found https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/manymodelr in testurls.txt, now validating.. 
Found https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymodelr in testurls.txt, now validating.. 
https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymodelr replaced with https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manymodelr/index.html 
in replacement.txt
Found https://tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing in C:\Users\Nelg\Desktop\urlfix\testurls.txt, now validating.. 
https://tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing replaced with https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html in 
replacement.txt
2 URLs have changed of the 3 links found in testurls.txt
2

```

To replace silently, simply set verbose to `False` (which is the default). 

```python
urlfix_object.replace_urls()
2 URLs have changed of the 3 links found in testurls.txt
2
```


**Replacing several files in a directory**

To replace several files in a directory, we can use `DirURLFix` as follows.

* Instantiate an object of class `DirURLFix`

```python

replace_in_dir = DirURLFix("path_to_dir")

```

* Call `replace_urls`

```python

replace_in_dir.replace_urls()

```
