# Welcome to urlfix's changelog 

**urlfix 0.2.1**

* Fixed issues with tests failing when run [consecutively](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/urlfix/pull/13) 

* Inplace replacement is no longer supported via the `inplace=True` argument. 

* Replacement of files now supports adding exceptions that is URLs whose links are known to be valid.

* Initial support for directory replacements, thanks to [nirolada](https://github.com/nirolada). 

**urlfix 0.2.0**

* `show_parsed_urls` was dropped. Future plans to find a better way to validate matched URLs.

* `find_links` was dropped. Everything is now done under `replace_urls`.

* `URLFix` is a new class to make it easier to write class methods and access class variables.

* `show_parsed_urls` is no longer necessary and may be dropped in future versions. 

* `replace_urls` was refactored to avoid unnecessary loops that would otherwise slow down the process.

* Extended sanity tests to ensure that input and output files exist. 

* `returned_matched` was dropped in `replace_urls`. Use `show_parsed_urls` for low level returns. 

* `verbose` in `replace_urls` is now more human friendly by providing the actual name of the output file.

* Updated `testurls.md` to ensure only markdown like links are replaced.

* The regular expression in `find_links` was replaced with a more robust one. 

* `visit_urls` was renamed to `replace_urls` and extended to allow inplace replacement (or not)
 as well as writing to an output file.
  
* `fixurls` was renamed to `urlfix`.

* `check_url` was removed but may be replaced. 

* Add more sanity checks to ensure that the regular expressions used work as detected.

* Made expected formats and return types more explicit. 

* Initial support for tests. 

* Fixed issues with installation
