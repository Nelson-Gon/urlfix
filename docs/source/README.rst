``urlfix`` aims to find all outdated URLs in a given file and fix them. 

**Supported file formats**

``urlfix`` fixes URLs given a file of the following types:


* [x] MarkDown (.md)
* [x] Plain Text files (.txt)

**Installation**

The simplest way to install the latest release is as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install urlfix

To install the development version:

Open the Terminal/CMD/Git bash/shell and enter

.. code-block:: shell


   pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git

   # or for the less stable dev version
   pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git@dev

Otherwise:

.. code-block:: shell

   # clone the repo
   git clone git@github.com:Nelson-Gon/urlfix.git
   cd urlfix
   python3 setup.py install

**Sample usage**

.. code-block:: python


   from urlfix.urlfix import *

**Create an object of class URLFix**

.. code-block:: python


   urlfix_object = URLFix("testurls.txt", output_file="replacement.txt")

**Replacing URLs**

After creating our object, we can replace outdated URLs as follows:

.. code-block:: python


   urlfix_object.replace_urls(verbose=1)

The above uses default arguments and will not replace a file inplace. This is a safety mechanism to ensure one does not
damage their files. 

Since we set ``verbose`` to ``True``\ , we get the following output:

.. code-block:: shell

   urlfix_object.replace_urls()
   Found https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/manymodelr in testurls.txt, now validating.. 
   Found https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymodelr in testurls.txt, now validating.. 
   https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymodelr replaced with https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manymodelr/index.html 
   in replacement.txt
   Found https://tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing in C:\Users\Nelg\Desktop\urlfix\testurls.txt, now validating.. 
   https://tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing replaced with https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html in 
   replacement.txt
   2 URLs have changed of the 3 links found in testurls.txt
   2

To replace silently, simply set verbose to ``False`` (which is the default). 

.. code-block:: python

   urlfix_object.replace_urls()
   2 URLs have changed of the 3 links found in testurls.txt
   2

**Replacing several files in a directory**

To replace several files in a directory, we can use ``DirURLFix`` as follows.


* Instantiate an object of class ``DirURLFix``

.. code-block:: python


   replace_in_dir = DirURLFix("path_to_dir")


* Call ``replace_urls``

.. code-block:: python


   replace_in_dir.replace_urls()
