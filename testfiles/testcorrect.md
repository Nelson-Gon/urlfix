[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/manymodelr)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymodelr)
This document does not contain anything special. It is simply a test document to ensure that we actually match 
and replace what is expected. We should replace
![test-coverage](https://www.github.com/Nelson-Gon/manymodelr/workflows/test-coverage/badge.svg) and 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3891106.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891106).  
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891106 should also be replaced since it is outdated. Everything else should remain
intact. We also have this non-existent [link](https://ww123.githib.comnotreal) that we should test.
