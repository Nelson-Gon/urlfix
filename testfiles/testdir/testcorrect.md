[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/manymodelr)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymodelr)
What if we have two [links](https://github.com) on the same [line](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon)? They should be 
matched and if verbose is set printed on the console. The expected number of URLs should also involve them. We need to
replace ![test-coverage](https://www.github.com/Nelson-Gon/manymodelr/workflows/test-coverage/badge.svg) or
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3891106.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891106).  
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891106 should also be replaced since it is outdated. Everything else should remain
intact. This [link](https://ww123.githib.comnotreal) and [fake link](https://gugol23.234com) are fake and should be kept.
