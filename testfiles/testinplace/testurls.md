This document does not contain anything special. It is simply a test document to ensure that we actually match 
and replace what is expected. We should replace
![test-coverage](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/manymodelr/workflows/test-coverage/badge.svg) and 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3891106.svg)](https://zenodo.org/record/5702564).  
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891106 should also be replaced since it is outdated. Everything else should remain
intact.
