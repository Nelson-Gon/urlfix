## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document that is used to test that `urlfix` can updated outdated links. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF,
and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages(c("mde", "manymolder"))
```

the famous [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing). 

That's it.Nothing fancy.
